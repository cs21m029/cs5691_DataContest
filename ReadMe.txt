Needed library installed To Run the Code : sklearn , numpy , pandas , imblearn

Running command : python CS21M055_CS21M029.py

It will generate two CSV file Named one.csv and two.csv As we have to selected best two CSV on Kaggle.

one.csv gives 0.47597 mcc score on public test data on kaggle.
two.csv gives 0.46079 mcc score on public test data on kaggle. 



As We Have done All work on the google colab if on your machine it gives some Runtime Error then please copy our code 
and run it on the google colab , there it will run definitely without any error.

For using google colab you have to upload all 4 datasets on the current notebook.
This 4 datasets
Dataset_1_Training 19.67 MB
Dataset_1_Testing 15.18 MB
Dataset_2_Training 125.32 MB
Dataset_2_Testing 79.14 MB

After uploading datasets make sure that all the file size matches in MB in colab also , reason behind telling this is that 
sometimes due to connection error some datasets will only half uploaded and then it will give error in run time so Make sure
All 4 data set completely uploded and then run just one cell and two CSV file will be created.

or here is link of my final google colab notebook:

i have given the Access to all the TA here you just have to upload the data all 4 datasets and run just one
cell and two CSV file will be created.
